If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n\n### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-js-standard\n```\n\n## Change style (to semi or not to semi)\nYou can change from standard to semistandard and vice versa in the plugin settings.\n\n## Known issues\n\n### OSX\nIf you have your environment variables in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` like me and you launch Atom from the GUI it doesn't load environment variables, unless you launch it from the terminal. This is a known [issue](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/550).\n\nBecause of this you can't run node scripts, so you need to do a workaround.\n\nA workaround for this issue is to edit Atom init script and set \"dynamically\" `$PATH` variable.\nTo do so go: `Atom` -> `Open Your Init Script` and paste the following code:\n\n```coffeescript\nsys = require('sys')\nexec = require('child_process').exec;\n\nexec \"source ~/.bash_profile && echo $PATH\", (err, stdout) ->\n  process.env.PATH = stdout.replace '\\n', ''\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ricardofbarros/linter-js-standard/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ricardofbarros/linter-js-standard","_id":"linter-js-standard@0.3.0","_shasum":"279463c253aee2f5351bb4c1e9aa9dfef45791d1","_resolved":"file:../d-115517-5930-8onm8h/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115517-5930-8onm8h/package.tgz"}
